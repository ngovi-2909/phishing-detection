# phishing-detection

## In this project we will use machine learning to predict url is phishing or not 
We have consulted from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/mpwolke/phishing-detection-with-same-bait/input) and also we use https://app.neilpatel.com to get the web traffic, https://www.domcop.com/openpagerank/ to get page rank. If needed you can custom the function on your own to get features that you want. 

We use the url of this kaggle above and remove all of Ã­ts features, then we will extracted again base on our function that we custom some of its. We just extracted 49 features, and using different machine learning alrogithm to predict and we found that random forest is the best of our model so we use this algorithm for our predict.
